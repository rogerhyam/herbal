# Contact

Implementation of HTTP URIs for specimens is, by its nature, decentralised
so it is difficult to give a single point of contact.

If you need help implementing URIs for your collection or have comments about
this service or CSPP you could contact Anton or Roger in the first instance or
approach one of the institutions that already has URIs for their specimens.

## Anton GÃ¼ntsch 

Anton is chair of Information Science and Technology Commission (ISTC) of the
Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities (CETAF) as well as working at BGBM Berlin, 
one of the early implementers. <A.Guentsch@bgbm.org>

## Roger Hyam

Roger has been involved in biodiversity identifiers for too long. He developed
this service and maintains the URI implementation at RBG Edinburgh.
