# Contact

Implementation of HTTP URIs for specimens is, by its nature, decentralised
so it is difficult to give a single point of contact.

If you need help implementing URIs for your collection or have comments about
this service or CSPP you could contact Anton or Roger in the first instance or
approach one of the institutions that already has URIs for their specimens.
