# Implementers

Any natural history collection is free to implement persistant URIs for its
specimens so it can be difficult to keep track of who has implemented them and 
to what level they are implemented. Below is a list of the ones we know about if 
there an institution is missing please accept our appologies and get in contact
so we can add it in.
